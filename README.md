# 🚲 Bikeshare Beats: A Visual Symphony

## 🌟 Project Overview
This project aims to uncover insights into bikeshare usage patterns and the impact of COVID-19 on bikeshare operations. Utilizing data from several major cities, we employ Python and Tableau to analyze trends and present our findings through interactive visualizations.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze bikeshare usage before and after the onset of COVID-19.
- Identify peak usage times and popular stations.
- Assess the impact of COVID-19 on bikeshare ridership.

## 🛠️ Tools on Stage
- **Python**: Our data maestro, conducting the prelude of cleaning and analysis.
- **Tableau Desktop**: The stage where our data performs, delivering an interactive ballet of insights.

## 📚 Data Ensemble
A curated collection from city stages worldwide, capturing the ebb and flow of bikeshare movements, pre and post-COVID-19's curtain call.

## 🎨 Visualizations
- **Trend Over Time**: Line charts showing ridership trends.
- **Usage Heatmaps**: Heatmaps displaying peak usage times.
- **Station Popularity**: Maps highlighting the most popular stations.
